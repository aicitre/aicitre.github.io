PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WJAR) – When Tim Petit spent $640 on what was advertised as an exclusive **Trump-branded watch**, he expected a premium timepiece honoring the 45th U.S. president. Instead, he received an embarrassing collector's item: a watch that boldly misspells "Trump" as **"RUMP"**—missing the crucial first letter.

The limited-edition watch, one of only 250 made, was meant to be a special gift for his wife, Melanie. But what should have been a luxurious political keepsake turned into a **high-priced typo** that's now going viral.

### **"How Could This Get Past Quality Control?"**
Petit purchased the **Pink Inauguration First Lady model** after hearing a radio ad featuring Donald Trump's voice promoting the timepieces. The website, gettrumpwatches.com, markets them as the **"official watches of President Trump"**—though fine print reveals the company merely licenses Trump's name and likeness.

*"I noticed it right away—it just says 'RUMP,'"* Melanie told WJAR. *"For $640, you'd think someone would proofread before shipping."*

The couple's frustration grew when they struggled to get a response from the company. After WJAR reached out, the watchmaker apologized and offered to replace the defective timepiece—plus an **$800 coupon** for future purchases.

### **Why This "RUMP" Watch Is More Than Just a Typo**
1. **Licensing Questions**: The incident raises concerns about quality control for officially licensed political merchandise.
2. **Customer Service Fail**: The delayed response highlights issues with luxury product support.
3. **Collector's Oddity**: Some speculate the misprinted watch could become a valuable collector's item.

*"Someone in their licensing department really dropped the ball,"* Tim Petit said. *"This wasn't just a mistake—it ruined what should have been a special gift."*

The company claims no affiliation with Donald Trump or the Trump Organization, despite using his name and likeness. As for the Petits? They're waiting for their replacement watch—and hoping this time, it spells the name correctly.

**What do you think?** Should the company do more to compensate customers for such errors? Let us know in the comments.
